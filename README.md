# Memory Game Project

## How to Play

This memory matching game is simple to play (but was DIFFICULT to code for a novice!) with a click of your mouse. Click on two cards. If they match the icons will remain face up and if they don't match the icons flip back. Click two cards again, use that memory of yours once you get a feel for it in order to earn stars. The game ends when you've turned over all the cards. You'll have the option to either play again or exit. Have fun, I know I did almost each of the approximately 1,000 times I've played it in two months!

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
